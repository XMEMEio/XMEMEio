ðŸš€ **New Project Announcement: XMEME - The Decentralized Meme Coins Community ETF Token!**

We are excited to introduce XMEME, a groundbreaking project on the Binance Smart Chain that aims to revolutionize the world of meme coins. XMEME's mission is to create a decentralized Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that provides investors with exposure to both new and existing meme coins, ensuring they don't miss out on the next big thing in the crypto world.

**NOTE:**
For the immediate future, we have migrated all repositories from private SVN servers to GitHub. As each stage of the project is published, their status will change to 'public.' While we trust our testers, we are keeping the code public only at the last moment to make it difficult and prevent fraudsters from impersonating our project.
